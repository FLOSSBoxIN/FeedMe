Mobilizer and full text download

There are two mobilizer settings. One for sync time, one for reading time. And the setting of Mobilizer in feed setting dialog is for reading.

You can set the reading mobilizer by your self, but you CAN'T change sync mobilizer, FeedMe is the only option for this, so you can't find the setting of sync mobilizer.
